(1) Move stock config from the Python file into a separate database table and support a multi-user setup
  (e.g. use a user_id to separate between entries)
(2) Split up stocks.py into 3 different files: 
  - (1) is a precondition for this requirement, since the user profile has to be used across the files
  - forex.py to update/backfill Forex data (has to run first in the sequence)
  - stocks.py to update/backfill stock data and normalize to target currency (EUR) based on existing Forex data
    (query Forex table instead of calling API to not run into rate-limiting issues)
  - portfolio.py to update/backfill the portfolio based on the config
(3) Create better code structure for stocks to add additional indicators easily (e.g. via a new function inside an extensible for-loop)
(4) Add ATR indikator as a new metric and backfill for existing data
(5) Create test MySQL tables to try things out before applying the logic to the production tables
